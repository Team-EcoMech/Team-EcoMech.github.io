## 🌀 Introduction

With global energy demands rising, the search for renewable energy sources has become critical. Innovative solutions are needed to harness energy efficiently and sustainably.

This project aims to explore the feasibility and efficiency of integrating Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) along expressways in Sri Lanka to harness wind energy generated by passing vehicles and natural wind flows. Recognizing the untapped potential of wind energy in transportation corridors, our initiative seeks to design, simulate, and analyze small-scale VAWTs optimized explicitly for installation in the median strips of highways.

## 🌀 Aim
The primary aim of this project is to evaluate the potential of harnessing wind energy from highway environments, both from natural wind currents and the airflow induced by vehicular traffic, using appropriately designed wind turbines.


## 🌀 Objectives

- To analyze highway wind patterns to determine the potential for energy capture. 
- To design efficient vertical axis wind turbines suitable for median installation on highways.
- To employ Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques to simulate turbine performance.
- To outline procedures for pilot testing and scaling up turbine installation on highways.
